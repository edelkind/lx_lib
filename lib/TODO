- CRITICAL: ensure that all malloc implementations correctly handle malloc(0)
  (otherwise, change all instances where malloc() is used)

* continue work on string arrays (lx_sa_*)

* add a "sensitive data" function, and hooks throughout the library.  If the
sensitive data flag is set, zero all data before abandoning it.

* IMPROVEMENT: instead of allocating new memory for the *chomp() functions,
put the 'cstr' variable directly into ns.  Then, umm, just don't free it.
Then modify them to return void.
