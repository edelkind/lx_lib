at the suggestion of a co-worker, ran its4 on the code tree.  No problems
	were found (any warnings issued did not pertain).  I do not consider
	this to be a useful evaluation, however.

2001.04.04

add lx_strrev.c (lx_strrev())

...

2001.07.24

started work on documentation.

2001.07.25

added out-of-memory checking to chomp functions in lx_chop.c, but removed
user-error checks to ensure that s was allocated.  They're just plain
unnecessary.

continued work on documentation.

small cleanup of lx_free.c (lx_free() and lx_zfree())

name change: stralloc.c -> alloc.c

removed idiot-proofing (non-allocation ensurance) from lx_alloc() in lx_alloc.c

...

replaced makefile (and family)

moved bin, speedtests, and docs directories to their proper places
